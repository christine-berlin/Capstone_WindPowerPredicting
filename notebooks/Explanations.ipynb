    "When fitting an estimator repeatedly on the same dataset, but for multiple parameter values (such as to find the value maximizing performance as in grid search), it may be possible to reuse aspects of the model learnt from the previous parameter value, saving time. When warm_start is true, the existing fitted model attributes are used to initialise the new model in a subsequent call to fit.\n",
    "As a specific example, for ensembles like random forests, if warm_start=True any previously trained trees are kept on a second call to .fit(). If it's false, a second call to .fit() would first discard any existing trained trees.\n",

    "n_jobs is an integer, specifying the maximum number of concurrently running workers. If 1 is given, no joblib parallelism is used at all, which is useful for debugging. If set to -1, all CPUs are used. For n_jobs below -1, (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. For example with n_jobs=-2, all CPUs but one are used.\n",
